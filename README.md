## Introduction

We present a desktop application developed using **Java Swing** for managing sales and inventory in a small shoe store. The main objective of this system is to streamline daily operations, ensuring efficient stock control and accurate sales tracking.

The application provides a user-friendly **graphical interface (GUI)** that allows store managers and employees to perform essential tasks such as:
- **Registering and updating products** in the inventory.
- **Processing sales transactions** and generating receipts.
- **Tracking stock levels** to prevent shortages.
- **Managing customer information** for future reference.
- **Generating PDF reports** for inventory and sales within a specified date range.

The system utilizes **MySQL** as its database management system, implemented through **XAMPP**, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval. By leveraging **Java Swing**, the application ensures a responsive and intuitive experience, making it easy for users to interact with the system. The system is designed to handle real-time inventory updates, ensuring that sales automatically adjust stock levels. Additionally, the program includes **basic reporting features** to provide insights into sales performance and inventory status.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and database management in Java. It was developed as a **university project**, serving as a valuable tool for small businesses looking to modernize their operations while providing a foundation for further enhancements, such as integrating a database or expanding functionalities based on business needs.

Overall, this Java Swing application represents a robust solution for small-scale retail businesses seeking to improve efficiency and accuracy in their daily operations.
